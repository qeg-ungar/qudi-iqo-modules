        This function has to be used in alternative to the function HermesSetCameraPar() when the acquisition of a subarray is needed. Subarray acquisition has few limitations:
        - the pixels will be readout starting from the upper-left one and moving by rows of 32 pixels toward the center of the array
        - in live mode it is possible to acquire only 1, 2, 4, 8 full rows. If Live mode is started when the camera is set for a different number of pixels, an INVALID_OP error will be returned.
        - in snap and continuous mode any number of pixels ranging from 1 to 256 in the upper semi-array can be acquired (in any case starting from the corner and then reading by rows,
        i.e. if 67 pixel are required 2 rows of 32 pixels + 3 pixels from the third row will be acquired), PROVIDED that the total data acquired is an integer multiple of 1024 bytes.

        This function saves the acquired images on the hard disk. The output file format can be either a multipage TIFF with embedded acquisition metadata according to the OME-TIFF format or the proprietary Hermes format. For FLIM measurements, use the HermesSaveFlimDisk() function.
        If TIFF format is selected, the desired images will be saved in a file for each enabled counter. If Hermes format is selected a single Hermes file will be created for all the counters.
        OME-TIFF file could be opened with any image reader compatible with TIFF file, since metadata are saved into the Image Description tag in XML format.
        In order to decode OME-TIFF metadata, it is possible to use a free OME-TIFF reader, such as OMERO or the Bio-Formats plugin for ImageJ. For more details see the OME-TIFF web site:
        http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/. If subarray acquisition is enabled and the number of pixels is not an integer multiple of 32,
        the TIFF files will have as much rows of 32 pixels as needed to accommodate all pixels, and the missing pixels will be put to 0, e.g.  if 67 pixels are acquired, the TIFF image will be 32x3, with the last 29 pixels of the 3rd row set to 0.
        Hermes file are binary files composed by a header with acquisition metadata followed by raw image data, containing the 8/16 bit (integer) or 64 bit (double precision) pixel values in row-major order (refer to Figure 7 of the User Manual for pixels position and order). The byte order is little-endian for the 16 or 64 bit images.
        In case more counters are used, data are interlaced, i.e. the sequence of frames is the following:
        1st frame of 1st counter, 1st frame of 2nd counter, 1st frame of 3rd counter, 2nd frame of 1st counter, etc.
        The header is composed by a signature of 8 byte (0x4d5044ff04000000, starting with 4d on byte 0), and a metadata section of 1024 byte, as follows (multibyte fields are little-endian):

        | Byte offset   | Number of bytes   | Description                                    |

        For both formats, image data is composed by a set of images following a "FLIM first, time second scheme", i.e. with the following frame sequence:
        1st gate shift of 1st FLIM measurement, 2nd gate shift of 1st FLIM measurement,...,nth gate shift of 1st FLIM measurement,1st gate shift of 2nd FLIM measurement, 2nd gate shift of 2nd FLIM measurement,...,nth gate shift of 2nd FLIM measurement,etc.
        OME-TIFF file could be opened with any image reader compatible with TIFF file, since metadata are saved into the Image Description tag in XML format.
        In order to decode OME-TIFF metadata, it is possible to use a free OME-TIFF reader, such as OMERO or the Bio-Formats plugin for ImageJ. For more details see the OME-TIFF web site:
        http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/. OME-TIFF metadata include the ModuloAlongT tag, which allows the processing of FLIM data with dedicated FLIM software such as FLIMfit (see http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/partner/flimfit).
        Hermes file are binary files composed by a header with acquisition metadata followed by raw image data, containing the 8/16 bit pixel values in row-major order (refer to Figure 7 of the User Manual for pixels position and order). The byte order is little-endian for the 16 bit images.
        The header is composed by a signature of 8 byte (0x4d5044ff03000001, starting with 4d on byte 0), and a metadata section of 1024 byte described in function HermesSaveImgDisk().
